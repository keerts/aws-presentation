# AWS presentation

These are the sheets of the AWS presentation on April 28 at the HAN
(University of Applied Sciences) and later that day at Avisi for their tech day.

If you weren't there, there might be not much use in these slides. You need the
story with it (the presentation is Lessig-stylish). If you need an introduction to
AWS, I'd be happy to discuss the opportunities. Please contact me for the
details.

# Running

Run ```grunt serve``` and watch the output for hints.
